# DFA_GENERATOR

## Requirements
1.  	PIL
2.  	Pydot
3.  	graphviz
4.  	pyautogui
5.  	tkinter

## Local setup

We also have to download the Graphviz and set their bin path in our environment variables and then set in our code ( DFA.py 5th line). 

os.environ["PATH"] += os.pathsep + Graphviz bin path 

example : os.environ["PATH"] += os.pathsep + "C:/Program Files/Graphviz/bin"
